# SolidityPriceConverter


Simple smart contract built with solidity to determine price conversion with a simple FundMe contract to enable random users to be able to send ether to the contract.
This smart contract is solely built on the Goerli testnet and enables user to know the current Price of ETH in USD before being able to send ether to the contract.
Fell free to interact.
